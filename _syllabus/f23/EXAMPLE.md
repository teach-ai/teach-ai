lectureSummary: |
    This week opened with a recap of commmand that have
    been encountered by the course thus far. Stay tuned for
    a post about that coming soon.

    The focus of lecture this week shifted a little to
    trying to learn <em>how</em> to learn about a new
    tool. Specifically, we started from the notion of,
    given that <tt>tr</tt> is a &ldquo;cool command&rdquo;
    that you should learn about, what are the effective ways
    to learn about how a tool behaves?

    At the end of lecture, we explored how we can chain
    together individually simple commands to build powerful
    constructs. The homework explores this topic is a guided
    manner as well.
